# An option for Navigation in SwiftUI

There are many ways to do Navigation in the SwiftUI framework, here I'm going to show you a way to work with navigation using `Enums`.

## Configuring Views

First, we are going to have some views in our project, each view will only have the title as a `Text` 

![Screenshot 2024-12-03 at 10.47.16â€¯AM.png](Screenshot_2024-12-03_at_10.47.16_AM.png)

Inside each view weâ€™ll only have this content for now

```swift
struct ChildOne: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Child One")
    }
}
```

Now, the idea is to have an `enum` that conforms the protocol `Hashable` that helps us to move around between views on our project

```swift
enum NavigationEnum: Hashable {
    case childOne
    case childTwo
    case childThree
}
```

## Why do you need `Hashable` protocol?

Okay, the short answer would be that NavigationDestination ask you to use it.

The long answer would be that SwiftUI need `Hashable` in this case to uniquely identify the data type that is being received. Conforming `Hashable` protocol, generates a unique hash value that SwiftUI can use internally to differentiate between destinations. If you're using a `NavigationStack` with a `NavigationPath`, SwiftUI stores and compares these hash values to manage the navigation history efficiently.

## Now, configuring the MainView

We need to set up the `NavigationStack` and the `.navigationDestination` in our MainView

Also we need the NavigationLinks to tell the NavigationStack where we need to go.

In the `NavigationLinks` we can set the enum case we want to go.

```swift
NavigationLink(value: NavigationEnum.childOne) {
    Text("Go to child one")
}
```

We need a NavigationPath() in case we need to modify it or append a NavigationDestination to it 

```swift
@State var mainPath = NavigationPath()
NavigationStack(path: $mainPath) { }
```

The completed code should be something like this

```swift
struct MainView: View {
    @State var mainPath = NavigationPath()
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack(path: $mainPath) {
            VStack {
                Text("Main View")
                NavigationLink(value: NavigationEnum.childOne) {
                    Text("Go to child one")
                }
                NavigationLink(value: NavigationEnum.childTwo) {
                    Text("Go to child two")
                }
                NavigationLink(value: NavigationEnum.childThree(object: SomeObject())) {
                    Text("Go to child three")
                }
            }
            .padding()
            .navigationDestination(for: NavigationEnum.self) { nav in
                switch nav {
                case .childOne:
                    ChildOne()
                case .childTwo:
                    ChildTwo()
                case .childThree(let object):
                    ChildThree()
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Iâ€™m adding the case in childThree enum case, so the updated code for `NavigationEnum` looks like this.

```swift
enum NavigationEnum: Hashable {
    case childOne
    case childTwo
    case childThree(object: SomeObject)
}

struct SomeObject: Hashable {}
```

The `SomeObject` struct should also conforms the `Hashable` protocol in order for it to be used inside the `enum` .

## Our final View

Our View at the end should look like this

![Screenshot 2024-12-03 at 12.07.07â€¯PM.png](Screenshot_2024-12-03_at_12.07.07_PM.png)

When pressing in one of the buttons, we can be able to move around our views.

![Screenshot 2024-12-03 at 12.08.43â€¯PM.png](Screenshot_2024-12-03_at_12.08.43_PM.png)

We can add other buttons inside our Child Two view to navigate to others Views using the same .navigationDestination, it works because it inheriting the parent `NavigationStack`.

```swift
struct ChildTwo: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Child Two")
            NavigationLink(value: NavigationEnum.childThree(object: SomeObject())) {
                Text("Go to child three")
            }
        }
        
    }
}
```
